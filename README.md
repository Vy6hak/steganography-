# steganography-
This project implements image steganography in C, allowing a secret text message to be hidden inside an image and later extracted. It uses Least Significant Bit (LSB) manipulation on the image pixels for encoding and decoding, and provides separate programs to embed the message into a cover image and to retrieve it from the stego image
